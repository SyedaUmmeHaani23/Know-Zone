 Updated Project Title
KnowZone – India’s AI-Powered Platform to Ask, Connect, Discover & Grow

🚀 Updated Vision Statement
KnowZone is not just a college tool — it’s a national platform where students, faculty, and alumni from all Indian colleges can:

Connect across branches, years, and even institutions

Get AI-powered answers to career and academic questions

Discover internships, hackathons, and campus updates

Build networks through forums like VTU Forum, Autonomous Colleges Forum, North India Tech Forum, and more

Leverage Google tools like Gemini, Firebase, and Maps — making India’s student ecosystem smarter and more connected than ever before.

🏫 Multi-College Architecture
🔹 Firestore: Add a colleges Collection
Field	Type	Example

city	string	Mysuru
type	string	VTU / Autonomous / Govt / Private
forums[]	array	["VTU Forum", "South Zone Tech Forum"]
activeUsers[]	array	list of user IDs (optional)

🔹 Each user profile (users collection) will now also include:

forums[]: forum names user is part of (can auto-assign from college type)

canCrossConnect: boolean to allow pan-India networking

🧩 New Feature: Forums Engine
Page: Forums
Tab	What It Shows
My College Forum	Students & Faculty from same college
My Circle	VTU Forum, Autonomous Forum, etc. based on user's college type
All India Forum	Open space to connect with other college members

💡 What Students Can Do in Forums:
Post Q&A or discussion threads

Share career tips or questions (e.g., "Best DS Algo resources for VTU 3rd sem?")

Share Google form links to events, internships

Tag seniors/alumni for mentorship

Like, comment, and follow users from other colleges

✨ Pitch Upgrade for Video / Application
“At KnowZone, I’m not just solving for one college. I’m solving for millions of students across India who don’t have access to clear guidance, connection, or opportunity discovery. From a student in Mysuru to one in Punjab or Kerala, KnowZone helps you ask questions, connect with peers and faculty, and grow together — all powered by Google technologies like Firebase, Gemini AI, and Google Maps. This is India’s first AI-powered student platform at national scale.”

Extend the app to support multiple colleges across India. Create a colleges collection. Each user should be linked to their college via collegeId. Based on college type (VTU, Autonomous, etc.), auto-enroll users into relevant forums like "VTU Forum", "Autonomous Colleges Forum", etc.

Create a “Forums” page with three tabs:
- My College Forum
- My Circle (based on college type)
- All India Forum (open to all)

Each forum should allow students to post, comment, tag others, and like posts. Posts stored in a forumPosts collection with fields: {id, forumName, title, body, authorId, ts}

Also allow cross-college chat/discovery based on LinkedIn connections.
