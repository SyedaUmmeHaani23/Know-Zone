Create a full-stack AI web app called “KnowZone – One App to Ask, Connect, Discover & Grow Together”.

💡 Key Features (Use Google tools wherever applicable):

Role-based login for Students/Alumni and Faculty using Firebase Auth.

On signup, collect:

Name, Email, Role, Branch, Year, Batch, USN, College Name (all required)
LinkedIn Profile (optional)
For faculty: Employee ID, Designation, Subjects, Experience.
Save all this in users collection.
“Ask KnowZone” page with Gemini Chat Block (API key already obtained) – connect to Gemini 2.5.

“Opportunities” page (use posts collection) – list events, internships, hackathons with filtering.

“MentorConnect” – ask questions to seniors/faculty (anonymous or public). Use questions collection.

“Lost & Found” page – upload & view lost items. Use lostFound collection.

“Faculty Dashboard” – show separate view for teachers to:

View student questions and reply
Post documents, resources, or department circulars
“LinkedIn Connect” Page – filter users from users collection where linkedin field exists, and display profile cards with name, branch, year, LinkedIn link.

“Bus Tracker” – embed Google Maps live tracking link from busRoutes collection. Students should only view buses they are assigned to. Show co-passengers from the same bus.

Smart Notification logic (use Cloud Functions/FCM) – send daily/weekly opportunity alerts based on user’s interests.
